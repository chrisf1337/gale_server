\begin{frame}{What is Gale?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Event scheduling app for busy people with changing schedules
    \item Existing methods are inconvenient
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traditional event schedulers make you specify multiple
        possible times
        \item Individually messaging/emailing/texting friends is tedious
        \item Group messaging friends is annoying if you don't want to
        invite everybody in the group
        \item Getting group messaged is annoying if you don't want to attend
        the event
        \item And more...
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Gale's solution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make event scheduling like Snapchat---immediate and simple
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Easily make events and invite friends
        \item Quickly respond to event invites
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example use case: I want to grab lunch in 30 minutes with a few
    friends, but I haven't made plans with anybody specific
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I specify where and when I will go for lunch
        \item I choose which friends I want to invite
        \item Invitees receive a notification and must immediately respond
        \item Reminder before event
        \item I can see who is coming to the event and can plan accordingly
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why is this better?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Location and time are fixed $=$ no arguing!
    \item I can choose exactly who I want to invite
    \item No cases where an invitee puts off responding to an event and forgets
    about it
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Application of class concepts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SQL queries
    \item ER model for designing our database
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Join tables for many-to-many relations
        \item Foreign key references
    \end{itemize}
    \item Normalization
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
